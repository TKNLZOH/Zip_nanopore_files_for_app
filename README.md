Helper script for use with HGAPP. 

After downloading the appropriate file, copy it to the parent directory of your files (example):
C:\Users\YourName\fastq_data\

├── sample1\
│   ├── file1.fastq.gz
│   └── file2.fastq.gz
└── Windows_zip.bat

Run the script by: 
•	For Linux: right click in your parent directory (the directory where you have the Unix_zip.sh file) and select “open terminal” and type: bash Unix_zip.sh
•	For Windows (Windows_zip.bat): simply double-click the file 
The zip files may then be uploaded to the application.
